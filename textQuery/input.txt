In the courses related to drawing circuits in colleges and universities, 
as well as in the homework submission system that requires drawing circuit diagrams
there has not yet been a web client that is common to teachers and students
with a simple interface, used for electronic circuit drawing.
All colleges and universities are basically in use large commercial software such as Multisim.
This research is based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript front-end language,
Java back-end language, 
SSM framework (Spring + SpringMVC + MyBatis) 
and canvas graphics API to develop a lightweight, 
and webpage-based drawing software that interacts with the back-end MySQL storage component database, 
and gradually improved to make its interface simpler, 
more user-friendly, and convenient for users to use and manage.
This software can realize the functions of adding, 
deleting, rotating and connecting basic circuit devices. 
Its greater advantage is that in the component library management interface,
it can be modified based on existing components, instead of writing component data in the source code, 
which is convenient and quick.
After the software was completed, 
a series of tests were carried out according to specific requirements. 
The test results are consistent with expectations, and the drawing task of the circuit diagram can be completed to meet the design requirements.
